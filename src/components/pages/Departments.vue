                      The children’s church is for children of all ages, up to age eleven. The teachers get the best out of our children, especially when it comes to special occasions when they put up laudable performances. For the very young children, teachers may find themselves having to be child minders apart from teachers. The children’s church is a home away from home where we equip and shape children with the word of God to become completely spiritually physically, mentally and morally fit individuals who stand out to become powerful witnesses for Christ in their generation.

                      The team ensures that church premises are kept clean at all times. Working behind the scenes, they ensure that the environment is always clean and free of contamination at all times. They see to the arrangement of the chairs and other bits and pieces needed for every service. They also decorate the altar, other parts of the church and change such decorations from time to time. After each service, they clean the church
                      premises again before leaving for home.

                      All Christians have a mandate to preach the gospel to all nations. As a church, in order to do this effectively, there is a dedicated team of men and women of God who make up the evangelism team with the responsibility for spreading the good news of Jesus Christ to everyone as well as making disciples of the saved. They go out to town centres, shopping malls, and the neighbourhood to preach the word of God and the salvation message. Members of the team also advertise the church and its programs with leaflets, flyers and handbills.

                      The music department is made up of the choir known as “Voice of Victory” and the instrumentalists. They are responsible for providing music in times of praise, worship and music ministrations. Rehearsals take place once a week, but are more frequent when there are upcoming special events. This provides an opportunity for members of the department to pray together, share new songs and rehearse for upcoming presentations.

                      The youth fellowship is concerned with catching the attention of youths with spiritual things and arresting them from worldliness. The purpose of the youth fellowship is for every youth to make heaven. It also aims to encourage youths to use their boundless energies and creativity in the service of God and for godly purposes. Teaching is a key part of the Youth fellowship and involves in-depth explanations, relating and communicating the word of God to the youths. Youths are encouraged to participate in active discussions with their teachers moderating. There will be seminars, debates, quizzes and games, video nights, all geared towards keeping the youths interested in God and the things of God. Youths also get to go out to fun places like theme parks, picnics and so on. The Youth church has its own functional departments such as drama, choir and dance amongst others.
